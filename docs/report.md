:Project: Teaching: literature review: should online teaching be recorded live?

- `[1]`: I do think this is useful, because its says what could go wrong and while its also useful like the papers pros and cons , for example here they point out why it should not be recorded "s. One unintended result of recorded lectures is that students may stop coming to campus, which could weaken the success, usefulness, and impact of student professional groups and organizations. Relying completely on online classes might also limit students’ ability to interact with people in real life situations without using technology.”" and here why they think its good ", in
some cases, can be reused in other or future classes, which helps save teachers’ time.” They do give reason to why it could be good but it more on the side which does not think its should be recorded

- `[2]`: i also think this is useful because it shows precentage of the students opinion and it also showed the aftermath as if somebody viewed the recording after, they said " 6 months after the recording no student rewatched the recording for over a minute" and it told us that recording is no big of a use in classes even though 100% of the student described it as "useful" and in this article they tell us straight up they do not support the routine of recording classes
