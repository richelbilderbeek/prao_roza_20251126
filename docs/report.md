Project: Teaching: literature review: should online teaching be recorded live?

- `[1]`: I do think this is useful, because its says what could go wrong and while its also useful like the papers pros and cons , for example here they point out why it should not be recorded "s. One unintended consequence
of recorded lectures is that absenteeism from campus might
erode the viability, productivity, and influence of student
professional associations and organizations. A complete reliance on online classes might hamper student ability to
personally interact with individuals or groups in situations
devoid of technology." and here why they think its good ", in
some cases, recorded lectures can be re-purposed for use in
other or future classes, thereby freeing faculty time."
