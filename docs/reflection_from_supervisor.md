# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well


## What I could do better


## My conclusion about my PRAO

- Roza was 32 minutes late and had forgotten her laptop.
  I hope she learns to be on time and be prepared next time
- When I sent Roza home to fetch her laptop, she took it well:
  it shows she is flexible
