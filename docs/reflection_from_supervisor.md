# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well


## What I could do better


## My conclusion about my PRAO

- Roza was 32 minutes late. I hope she learns to be on time next time
- Roza had forgotten her laptop. I hope she learns to be prepared next time
- Roza dares to ask for help: when she first arrived at my
  office, there was a man with here that showed her the way to my office
- Roza is flexible:
  when I sent Roza home to fetch her laptop, she took it well
