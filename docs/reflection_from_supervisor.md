# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I treated Roza like a real colleague.

## What I could do better

I had too much fun talking to such a gifted mind: maybe I should have treated her worse.

## My conclusion about my PRAO

- Roza was 32 minutes late. I hope she learns to be on time next time
- Roza has a good work ethics: she did not mind to work longer to make up for being late
- Roza had forgotten her laptop. I hope she learns to be prepared next time
- Roza dares to ask for help: when she first arrived at my
  office, there was a man with here that showed her the way to my office
- Roza is great at saying what she thinks
- Roza dares to disagree, does so politely and can give proper reasons why her viewpoint differs

My recommendation to a future employer would be to **absolutely** try to get her: she is one of the most allround gifted minds at her age that I ever met.

If Rosa ever needs help, I will happily help out as much as I can. Thanks for the fun day!

  
- Roza is flexible:
  when I sent Roza home to fetch her laptop, she took it well
