# Tips from former students

> Stay calm and focused and you will get it done, even if it feels stressful
> you'll get it done in the end. Remember the goal of a PRAO.
> The start is the hardest, it gets easier.

> Make sure to get a good idea of what to do before starting so that
> you don't lose time due to misunderstanding the assignment.

> Listen carefully to the explanations when you're given them.
> If you lose focus important information could be lost on you,
> and if you simply listen and take your time processing the info,
> a lot of issues can be avoided.

> Take time to think through and plan the assignments beforehand
> so you have more time to spend writing and doing the assignment.

[Johannes](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/prao_johannes_20251107)

> Do your best! Don't give up, it might be hard at first but it gets better.
> Just belive in yourself and you will make it!
